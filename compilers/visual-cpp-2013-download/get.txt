- Download Visual Studio 2013 Express
- Install it
- Copy
  - Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0/VC into ../visual-cpp-2013/vc-12.0
  - Program Files/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A into ../visual-cpp/winsdk-v7.1a
- If your Wine version does not contain msvc[pr]120.dll, copy them from
  vs-12.0/redist/x86/microsoft.vc120.crt to both cl.exe. If your Wine has
  incomplete builtin msvc[pr]120.dll (as Wine 1.7.33), also set override for
  those two libraries.
